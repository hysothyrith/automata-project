# Automata Project

## Instructions

1. Write all your automaton functions in `src/lib/automaton.ts`. The function signatures are already defined, but you can modify them as you see fit.
2. Example automata definitions can be imported from `src/lib/example-automata.ts`.
3. This project uses Typescript, but not in “strict” mode, so any normal JavaScript should work.
4. You can install any npm package you need.
